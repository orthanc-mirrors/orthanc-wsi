* Added support for JPEG-LS in OrthancWSIDicomizer with argument "--compression=jpeg-ls"
* Fix photometric interpretation of JPEG2000 images generated by OrthancWSIDicomizer
  (now set to RGB instead of YBR_FULL_422)


Version 3.1 (2025-03-17)

Compatibility notes about the viewer
------------------------------------

* Compatibility tested against sample DICOM images shipped by OpenSlide:
  3DHISTECH-1.zip, CMU-1-JP2K-33005.zip, JP2K-33003-1.zip, and Leica-4.zip:
  https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/DICOM/

* Compatibility tested against the images of the 2023 DICOM WG26 Connectathon
  from vendors: Hamamatsu, Leica, Objective Imaging, Philips, and Roche

Version 3.0 (2024-12-20)
========================

=> Minimum SDK version: 1.7.0 <=

* On-the-fly creation of pyramids from frames of DICOM instances ("deep zoom" button)


Version 2.1 (2024-10-18)
========================
